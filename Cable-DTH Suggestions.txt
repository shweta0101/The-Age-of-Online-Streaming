Cable/ DTH can improve the content quality as well as the costs can also be reduced which would upto a certain extent sustain the life of Cable/DTH considering the choices of future generation.
Prices are channel to be minimum range
Cable/DTH should improve their service by providing the Access of all shows 24x7 . They should reduce their service charges as well. Tata sky currently charges 153rs for service charge which I feel is too much. Also they should improve the content of the shows because new generation doesn't like to watch Saas Bahu serials.

"The ""pack"" system must be removed. Because, in this system, we would get many unwanted channels as they are a part of the pack and we can't have access to channels that we wish because the pack in which it is available, has other channels which we don't need. So for one single channel, it is not useful to buy the whole pack.
Moreover, initially when all channels were available in all languages, there was an opportunity to learn more languages and cultures and it was more entertaining then."
